# Typing Practice

Welcome to **Typing Practice**! üéâ

## Overview

Typing Practice is a fast-paced typing test game built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this version, we've made some exciting upgrades:
- **Word-based Typing**: Instead of typing long texts, you will now type individual lowercase English words.
- **Performance Tracking**: The game counts the number of correct and incorrect words you type.
- **Timer**: Challenge yourself against the clock to improve your typing speed and accuracy.

You can install and test it on your site right away!

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: The CSS file is empty. I left the styles and design up to you! Feel free to customize the appearance to your liking.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engaging and fun typing test.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Real-time feedback on your typing performance.
